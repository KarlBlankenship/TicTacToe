#Tic Tac Toe
This is intended to be simple tic tac toe game that will become more complex as my
coding ability progresses.
Initially I am looking for a text based game with a person vrs a computer player that
uses strictly random play.
I would like to move to a graphic game and eventually build some strategic game-play 
into the computer player.
